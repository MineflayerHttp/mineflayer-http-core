# mineflayer-http-core
This is the core program to make the apis in other languages work.

> **Disclaimer:** This is currently in development. You can check it out on the [develop branch](https://github.com/MineflayerHttp/mineflayer-http-core/tree/develop) if you would like to help test this out! I will be adding api documentation soon.
